        <h2>Why do you want to take this course?</h2>
        <p>I would like to take this course because front-end development is the foundation of creating user-friendly, interactive websites and applications. I am passionate about designing engaging digital experiences, and believe mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will give me the ability to take creative ideas and make them work functionally.</p>

        <h2>What do you aim to learn by the end of this course?</h2>
        <p>By the end of this course, I hope to have a thorough knowledge base about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their collaborative role in creating responsive and visually appealing websites. Besides, I would like to learn about best practices in coding and structuring web pages and improving performance. Also, I am looking forward to gaining practical experience by completing projects that will be useful in proving my ability to develop real-world applications.</p>

        <h2>How do you think this course will benefit you in your future goals?</h2>
        <p>This course will benefit me by providing the technical foundation necessary for a career in web development. As front-end skills are highly in demand, learning them will open up opportunities in the tech industry. Additionally, understanding how to build user-friendly interfaces will be valuable as I explore more advanced topics like frameworks, back-end development, or even UX/UI design. It will also boost my confidence in working on freelance projects or collaborating with teams.</p>

        <h2>List any specific tools you want to learn (like Tailwind or React etc.)</h2>
        <p>I am very excited to learn tools and frameworks like React, with which I can build interactive user interfaces; Tailwind CSS, for fast and simple styling; and Git, to track changes and collaborate with others. In addition, I want to learn about development tools—VS Code, browser developer tools, ways of fixing problems—that will make my work easier.</p>
